👋 Hi, thanks for stopping by

I’m Camila, a Software Engineer with a frontend focus, building scalable, high-performance applications with strong architectural foundations.


🚀 About Me

With 6+ years of experience, I work on complex products where performance, maintainability, and user experience are critical. My background is strongly rooted in frontend engineering, but always from a software engineering perspective — thinking in terms of architecture, trade-offs, scalability, and long-term evolution of systems.

I’ve contributed to high-traffic e-commerce platforms and B2C/B2B SaaS products, collaborating closely with product managers, designers, and backend teams in agile environments. My work has directly impacted checkout performance, SEO-driven traffic growth, conversion improvements, and reduced operational overhead through better frontend architecture and user flows.

From a technical standpoint, I frequently work with modern frontend stacks such as React, Next.js, and TypeScript, alongside strong testing practices, CI/CD pipelines, and accessibility (a11y) standards. I value clean code, clear abstractions, and frontend systems that scale gracefully as products grow.

My academic background in information management and digital resource organization shaped my understanding of how information is indexed, structured, and discovered — which directly informs my approach to SEO and content-driven applications.

Having lived and worked across different countries in Europe, I’m comfortable in distributed teams and multicultural environments.
